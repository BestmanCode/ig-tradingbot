==========

A lightweight Python wrapper for the IG Markets API. Simplifies access to the IG REST and Streaming APIs.

What is it?
-----------

`IG Markets <https://www.ig.com/>`_ provides financial spread betting and CFD platforms for trading equities, forex,
commodities, indices, cryptocurrencies, bonds, rates, options and more.

IG provide APIs so that developers can access their platforms programmatically. Using the APIs you can
get live and historical data, automate your trades, or create apps. For details about the IG APIs please see their site:

https://labs.ig.com/

NOTE: this is not an IG project. Use it at your own risk


Dependencies
------------

A number of dependencies in this project are marked as 'optional', this is *by design*. There is a brief
explanation in :ref:`this FAQ item <optional-dependencies>`.

For full details, see `pyproject.toml <https://github.com/ig-python/ig-markets-api-python-library/blob/master/pyproject.toml>`_

Support
------------
This is an open source project, maintained by busy volunteers in their spare time. It should make it easier and
quicker for you to use the IG APIs. However, it is not a support resource for users of the IG APIs. IG have their
